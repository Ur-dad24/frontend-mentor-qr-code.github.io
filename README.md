## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to create a responsive QR code component using HTML and CSS. I used flexbox to center the content vertically and horizontally within the parent container. I also applied styling to the QR code image and the text content using CSS properties such as `border-radius`, `padding`, and `font-family`. 

Here's an example of the code I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  width: 230px;
  padding: 15px 0;
  border-radius: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on improving my CSS skills, particularly in layout and responsiveness. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques and frameworks to enhance the design and functionality of my projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/): This is my go-to resource for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides detailed explanations and examples for various web development concepts.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/): This website offers a wealth of CSS-related articles, tutorials, and code snippets. It's a great resource for learning and staying up-to-date with the latest CSS techniques.
